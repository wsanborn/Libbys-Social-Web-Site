        <p class="about">Hi, my name is Libby and I am a content creator for a wide variety of social media platforms! 
            The platform I put the most emphasis on is one called dtube.video. 
            Dtube is a video-sharing website that is completely decentralized, has no middle man, and runs on cryptocurrency. 
            This means I (and you if you <a class="join" href="https://d.tube/" target="_blank"> joined</a>) have total freedom over what I post and what I want to say or do within that post! 
            You can see some examples of the content I post there below. 
            But as I said before, I have a wide range of platforms that I am invested in and topics I find interesting, such as: makeup photos on Instagram, 
            conspiracy theory and review videos on Dtube, a podcast discussing <a class="church" href="https://www.facebook.com/bradfordmechurch" target="_blank"> Christianity</a> 
            on pretty much any app where podcasts are available;
            and funny videos on Twitter and Snapchat! To find a few sneak peeks and links to those sites just check down below! I am also an avid chef/baker 
            (althought not at all professionally) and I love reading and writing. Thank you so much for stopping by and I hope you find something you enjoy on my page!  
        </p>

            <p class="instaTxt"> Instagram is one of the platforms where I have the most fun and just let myself be creative in whatever way I want to.
                I don't put a lot of pressure on myself to stay within the "norms" of makeup, which is why a lot of people think I'm crazy when they see my page!
                I like to do crazy looks a lot, but I also love just an everyday makeup look. If you want to see some fun makeup looks and how I express myself
                through my version of art, check out my <a class="instaLink" href="https://www.instagram.com/booksandbeauty129/" target="_blank">page!</a>  </p>
